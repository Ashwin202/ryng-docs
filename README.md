## API Rate Limits

To ensure optimal performance and fair usage, the Ryng API enforces a rate limit of **60 requests per minute.** We encourage developers to design their integrations with this limit in mind to avoid any service disruptions.

To request an increase in the rate limit, please contact our support team.

## Authentication

Security is a top priority at Ryng, and as such, access to our API requires authentication. An authentication token will be **provided by the Ryng team,** which must be included in the header  `x-access-token` of each API request. This token is essential for authorizing your requests and ensuring secure data transmission to and from our system. Please contact our support team to obtain your authentication token and get started with your integration.
